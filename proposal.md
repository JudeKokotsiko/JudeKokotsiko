# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will likely be: Movie Recommendation System with a Flask Web Interface.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a Python-based application, built with Flask, that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their different preferences, such us "favorite genre", or "specific movie titles".

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The Movie Recommendation System will allow users to input their movie preferences, such as "genres", "directors", or even "specific titles", and the system will generate a list of similar movies it thinks they might also enjoy. The system will utilize a rich dataset of movies, including attributes like "titles", "genres", "directors", and "plot descriptions".
The functionalities will include:
-Web interface: this will be a user friendly web application built with Flask, where users can interact with the system by entering their preferences.
-Data handling: this will be the backend that processes movie data from a preloaded dataset, using Python libraries like pandas and numpy for filtering and recommendation.
-Recommendation engine: this will be the advanced recommendation logic based on genre, director, and textual similarity.
-Features: users will have the ability to filter by release year, popularity, or runtime, and to handle user feedback(like/dislike.)
The project will use Flask for hosting the web interface, which would make it accessible in any browser. The backend will integrate Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and potentially NLTK or Spacy for natural language processing.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not Applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A web-based application built with Flask that accepts user input and provides movie recommendations based on genre and directors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The application includes advanced filtering(e.g., by release year, popularity, or runtime) and stores user feedback in a database to refine recommendations.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have a polished Flask web app that uses advanced NLP techniques to recommend movies based on textual similarity and supports interaction(e.g., handling like/dislike feedback to improve results).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

-I will need to learn Flask and how it is used; I would need to understand how to create routes, templates, and serve a functional web app.
-I will have to select an open-source movie dataset or multiples, and then clean and preprocess them if necessary.
-I will need to explore text similarity techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for matching movies based on plot descriptions.
-I will use CSS to create a simple but visually appealing interface for the Flask application.
-Incorporating MySQL database to store user feedback for improving recommendations can also be helpful.
