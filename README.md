Final Project Idea
Project Idea: Movie Recommendation System

Description:
I plan to build a Python-based movie recommendation system. The project will take a user's movie preferences as input (like favorite genres or specific movies) and return recommendations based on similarity.

Main Components:

Data Collection and Processing:

Collect and clean movie data by focusing on genres, directors, and keywords.

Similarity Matching:

Implement a similarity algorithm, starting with genre and keyword matching and potentially adding more advanced text-based similarity.

User Interaction:

Create a command-line interface where users can enter preferences and receive recommendations.
